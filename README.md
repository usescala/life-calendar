Utah Scala Enthusiasts - September 2016 Meeting - Lab

Life Calendar
=============

The inspiration for this project came from watching [Tim Urban's TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator?language=en) entitled, 
"Inside the mind of a master procrastinator" filmed Feb 2016. In this talk, he describes one of the problems that promotes procrastination in our lives is not having a dead line
for a particular project or goal. This is often because these projects/goals are, at the time, so far in the future that we lose perspective. The concept of a life calendar helps 
reign that in by plotting each week of a 90 year life as a dot in a single chart. More information regarding Tim's ideas and research regarding this can be found on his blog,
[Wait But Why](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html).


Overall Goal
============

The goal of this exercise is to implement a life calendar using mostly Scala and the [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/). AngularJS 1.5.7 and ReactJS 15.2.1 
are also included in this project if you choose to use them, although the overall goal of this exercise is to practice Scala. Since the group includes people
with all levels of skill in Scala, the tasks are structured with the intention that everyone can learn something within the time constraints. Additionally, 
Bootstrap 3.7.1 is already included if you would like to add some styling to your life calendar.


Tasks
========

* Understand the existing code
* Update the code to display a "90-Year Human Life in Weeks"
* Update the code to add both X & Y axis labels. (0, 5, 10, etc)
* Update the code to color code the weeks with the "Life of a Typical American"
* Update the code to take an optional Birth Date that will highlight in the chart where a person of that age falls.
* Update the code to highlight additional average life events. (e.g. Get drivers license, can legally drink, life expectancy)


You are not required to keep the existing structure in the code. If it helps you to change something, then change it. This existing structure is just meant to give you a 
starting point.
